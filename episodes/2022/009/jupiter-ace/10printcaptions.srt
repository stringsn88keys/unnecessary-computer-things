Welcome to another
Unnecessary Computer Things

0:03
Today we're going to try to
recreate the 10 PRINT Maze

0:06
in Jupiter ACE Forth

0:09
First we set up a pseudo
random number generator

0:15
These first few words /
functions are from the

0:18
Jupiter ACE Manual itself,
pages 82 through 84.

0:25
This first method, seedon,
gets the next random number
seed.

0:35
seed is a 16-bit integer
that jumps around enough

0:40
from our calculations to
look random.

0:46
the "@" symbol retrieves
the seed variable

0:52
then we manipulate it to
get a new value

1:00
finally we duplicate it
and "!" stores the value

1:06
back out to the variable.

1:12
Now that we have a seed value on
the top of the stack we can use that

1:18
in our rnd word.

1:24
We call the seedon word to get a new
value and then multiply that value

1:30
by a number 'n' that we placed on the
stack, to get a random number from

1:36
0 to n-1

1:42
I'm also going to include this rand
word that uses a slightly more

1:48
random value on a real Jupiter Ace
than the fixed seed we start with...

1:55
The location 15403 is the number of
frames displayed since power on,

2:01
and we'll initialize with that
value if 0 is on the stack before

2:06
the call.

2:30
This next word, gr, is on page 71 of
the manual, and allows you to

2:36
define an 8 by 8 character graphic
with 8 8-bit values on the stack

2:42
and the character code to assign
the mapping to.

2:50
11263 through 12287 store the patterns
for characters 0 through 127

2:56
8 bytes per character (1024 bytes
total)

3:06
c! (c-store) stores a single byte in an
address

3:12
We're actually starting at the end of
the memory slot for a character

3:16
because we're going to be putting the
values on the stack in order.

3:24
We're using i for the offset that
we're tracking in a do loop

3:30
and then doing a -1 at the end of the
iteration.

3:40
We end with a +loop, with is similar to
a branch if not equal instruction

3:46
in assembly that really just checks that
the loop variable is greater than 0.

3:51
Next, we define two characters using
base 2 (binary).

3:58
First, a backslash-like graphics
character. The text slashes don't

4:06
use all 8 lines, but only 4, so our
maze wouldn't have closed-in walls

4:12
if we used those.

4:15
We just put a 1 in for "on" pixels
and a 0 for "off" pixels.

4:35
Finally, we switch back to decimal
and call our "gr" word with "1" as

4:42
a character code.

4:46
Next, we reverse the order of the
pixels.

5:40
Now, we assign that to character 2.

5:45
Lastly, we write the maze word.

5:51
Clear the screen, loop 32 times 24
times (initialize loop counter to 0)

5:58
In the loop, emit a random number
and add 1.

6:24
Ok, so ERROR 2 is a buffer underflow.
What broke?

6:38
Well, the rnd word requires an "n"
value on the stack to set the random

6:44
range from 0 to n-1. Putting a 2 in
here will satisfy that requirement.

6:54
Now the maze should work!

7:03
Let's make that run a little longer
by adjusting that loop.

7:11
Oops... no colon before the edit
command.

7:20
Let's do 2 rows full of screens, or 48
lines.

7:59
This is definitely not a one-liner
maze, but a nice trade-off is that it

8:06
runs a lot closer to machine code,
because the words are compiled each

8:12
time. Also, a lot of the memory access
is stack-based (because it's Forth).

8:40
Ugh, who can type while being watched?
Thanks for watching!
