# unnecessary-computer-things

Source code for experiments presented on the [Unnecessary Computer Things channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd8UBDqyWl19Mxivv3sFDoQ)

## Organization

Source code for episodes will be uploaded to the `episodes/` folder, in subfolders for the `{year}.{episode}`, e.g., "Ep 2021.001" will be in `episodes/2021/001`. I will put the code for different machines in subfolders below that.
